# 🎵 Feature Analysis in Sound Recognition System  

This document explains the **audio features** analyzed by the system and their role in **sound classification**.  

---

## 📌 **1. Overview**  
The program processes **.wav audio files** and extracts sound features using **Librosa (Python)**. These features help in classifying the sound into genres and intensity levels.  

---

## 🔍 **2. Extracted Audio Features**  

| Feature               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Tempo (BPM)**      | Measures beats per minute to determine song speed. |
| **Spectral Centroid** | Identifies where most of the energy is concentrated in the frequency spectrum. |
| **Spectral Bandwidth** | Measures the range of frequencies present in the sound. |
| **Zero Crossing Rate** | Counts the number of times the signal crosses zero, useful for detecting percussive sounds. |
| **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** | Extracts patterns from speech/music to recognize genre or voice characteristics. |

---

## 🎼 **3. Feature Extraction Process**  
### **Step 1: Load the Audio File**  
Using `Librosa` to read the `.wav` file:  
```python
import librosa
y, sr = librosa.load("example.wav")
```
- `y`: Audio time series  
- `sr`: Sample rate  

### **Step 2: Extract Key Features**  
#### 🔹 **Tempo (BPM) Detection**
```python
tempo, _ = librosa.beat.beat_track(y=y, sr=sr)
print(f"Tempo: {tempo:.2f} BPM")
```
- Determines the speed of the music.  
- Faster BPM → **Rock/EDM**, Slower BPM → **Classical/Jazz**.  

#### 🔹 **Spectral Centroid (Frequency Distribution)**
```python
import numpy as np
centroid = librosa.feature.spectral_centroid(y=y, sr=sr)
print(f"Spectral Centroid: {np.mean(centroid)}")
```
- Higher values → **Brighter sound (Electric guitar, Cymbals)**.  
- Lower values → **Darker sound (Bass, Vocals, Classical instruments)**.  

#### 🔹 **Zero Crossing Rate (Percussive Sounds)**
```python
zcr = librosa.feature.zero_crossing_rate(y)
print(f"Zero Crossing Rate: {np.mean(zcr)}")
```
- High rate → **Percussion-heavy sounds (Drums, Rock, EDM)**.  
- Low rate → **Smoother sounds (Piano, Vocals, Jazz)**.  

#### 🔹 **MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) for Genre Classification**
```python
mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=y, sr=sr, n_mfcc=13)
print(f"MFCC Shape: {mfccs.shape}")
```
- Extracts vocal and instrument characteristics.  
- Helps differentiate between **Pop, Rock, Classical, and Jazz**.

## 🎯 **4. How These Features Are Used in Classification**  
| Feature | Genre Association |
|---------|------------------|
| **High BPM (120-180)** | Rock, EDM, Pop |
| **Low BPM (60-100)** | Jazz, Classical |
| **High Spectral Centroid** | Electric Guitar, EDM, Metal |
| **Low Spectral Centroid** | Classical, Piano, Soft Vocals |
| **High Zero Crossing Rate** | Drums, Percussion-heavy music |
| **Low Zero Crossing Rate** | Smooth sounds like Jazz, Classical |

## 🔬 **5. Future Improvements**  
✔ Integrate **Neural Networks (TensorFlow/PyTorch)** for **deep learning-based** sound classification.  
✔ Improve **real-time processing** with **microphone input** instead of saved `.wav` files.  
✔ Expand feature extraction to include **timbre, rhythm, and instrument recognition**.
