## 🚀 Overview
The **Sound Recognition Program** is a C++ terminal-based tool that records, processes, and analyzes audio files using AI-powered techniques. It uses **multithreading** for faster execution and integrates with **Python (Librosa)** for feature extraction.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Record audio** using FFmpeg/PortAudio (CLI-based)
✅ **Analyze sound features** (BPM, intensity, genre classification)
✅ **Asynchronous & multithreaded processing** for speed optimization
✅ **ASCII-based UI for better user experience**
✅ **AI-enhanced sound classification** (genre detection, intensity recognition)
✅ **Open-source & highly customizable**
